# Pass in deploy

## The deploy of a Participant management application using kubernetes

The idea behind the project is to deploy a application with Docker, Terraform
for PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean. container management with Kubernetes, testing locally
with K3D, Helm and automating this process with Argo. It was used Github Actions to
create the CI/CD process, using to update image tag version on Dockerhub and in helm
variables

This project is part of my personal portfolio, which I use to explore several deployment tools and
to learn more about the Devops culture
